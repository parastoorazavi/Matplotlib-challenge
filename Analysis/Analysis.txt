Observations and Insights   In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured.    There are a short analysis of received data:1. By looking at the bar chart, we can understand number of mice which is used for the test in Capomulin and Ramicane are more than others and Propriva has the least number. 2. By looking at the pie chart, we can understand 50.6% of samples are male and 49.4% are female which is an equal number of each sex in the study.3. By looking at the boxplot, we can understand Capomulin treatment and Ramicane treatment have a better effect to reduce the tumor volume4. By looking at the scatter plot, we can understand the strong positive relationship between weight (g) and average tumor volume (mm3) in Capomulin treatment, which means by increasing weight the tumor volume grows as well. The r-squared in this model is 0.70 which means 70% of samples fitted for this model.
